\fontsize{9}{11}\selectfont The traditional keyboard and mouse computer
interface is well suited for 2D applications such as document editing, but as 3D
environments become more prevalent there arises a need for new methods of user
input. An immersive 3D interface is preferable, but is often cost prohibitive.
This paper presents the design and implementation of a Natural User Interface
(NUI), named NuWii. NuWii was designed to be used with the Spiegel visualization
framework for astrophysical data. The interface makes use of Nintendo Wii
Remotes as infrared tracking cameras to detect 3D gestures made by the user.
These gestures are interpreted and used to control the viewing camera.s
parameters throughout the course of a visualization. Our project provides a new,
more intuitive way of manipulating the camera in the Spiegel visualization
system. Furthermore, NuWii provides an expandable base that could be used for
gesture control in many other applications.
